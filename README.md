# EVIL LARRY

EVIL LARRY is a task-management chatbot developed as a greenfield Java
project. Given below are instructions on how to use it.

## Building and running with Gradle

This project uses the Gradle Wrapper, so you do not need to install Gradle
globally. From the project root, use:

```bash
./gradlew build
./gradlew run --console=plain
```

The first command compiles the project and runs its automated tests. The second
command starts EVIL LARRY. Gradle downloads the project's declared Gradle
version on the first run and reuses it afterwards.

## Creating and running a fat JAR

Create a fresh fat JAR with the Shadow plugin from the project root:

```bash
./gradlew clean shadowJar
```

The generated file is `build/libs/larry.jar`. It contains EVIL LARRY's compiled
classes and all runtime dependencies, and its manifest identifies
`larry.Launcher` as the entry point.

Run the JAR using Java 25:

```bash
java -jar build/libs/larry.jar
```

EVIL LARRY reads and writes `data/larry.txt` relative to the directory where
this command is run. If the file or its parent directory does not exist, EVIL
LARRY creates them when the first task is saved. Enter `bye` to exit the
application.

### macOS and Linux (ARM64 Java)

Build a separate JAR with the ARM64 JavaFX libraries:

```bash
./gradlew shadowJarArm64
```

The output is `build/libs/larry-arm64.jar`. On an Apple Silicon Mac or Linux
ARM64 system with ARM64 Java 25, run `java -jar larry-arm64.jar`.
The existing `shadowJar` task still produces `larry.jar` for x64 Java on
Windows, Intel Macs, and Linux. To create both files, run
`./gradlew shadowJar shadowJarArm64`.

Windows ARM64 Java is not supported: the JavaFX 17.0.7 dependencies do not
provide Windows ARM64 native libraries. Linux ARM64 also requires a graphical
desktop and the native system dependencies required by JavaFX.

## Command reference

Commands are lowercase and case-sensitive. Task numbers are one-based.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `todo DESCRIPTION` | Add a todo. |
| `deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE_TIME` | Add a deadline. |
| `event DESCRIPTION /from DATE_TIME /to DATE_TIME` | Add an event whose end is after its start. |
| `list` | Show all tasks. |
| `find KEYWORD` | Find tasks by description. |
| `on DATE` | Show dated tasks occurring on a date. |
| `mark INDEX` | Mark a task as done. |
| `unmark INDEX` | Mark a task as not done. |
| `edit INDEX /description DESCRIPTION` | Change any task's description. |
| `edit INDEX /by DATE_TIME` | Change a deadline's due date and time. |
| `edit INDEX /from DATE_TIME` | Change an event's start date and time. |
| `edit INDEX /to DATE_TIME` | Change an event's end date and time. |
| `delete INDEX` | Delete a task. |
| `bye` | Exit Larry. |

Date-time values accept a time such as `0930` or `9:30`, optionally paired
with a day-month date such as `6-9`, `6/9/2026`, or `6-9-2026`. See the
[user guide](docs/README.md#editing-one-task-field-edit) for edit examples and
validation details.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 25, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 25** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
1. After that, locate the `src/main/java/larry/Larry.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Larry.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below as the output:
   ```
   ██╗      █████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗   ██╗
   ██║     ██╔══██╗██╔══██╗██╔══██╗╚██╗ ██╔╝
   ██║     ███████║██████╔╝██████╔╝ ╚████╔╝
   ██║     ██╔══██║██╔══██╗██╔══██╗  ╚██╔╝
   ███████╗██║  ██║██║  ██║██║  ██║   ██║
   ╚══════╝╚═╝  ╚═╝╚═╝  ╚═╝╚═╝  ╚═╝   ╚═╝
   ```

**Warning:** Keep the `src\main\java` folder as the root folder for Java files (i.e., don't rename those folders or move Java files to another folder outside of this folder path), as this is the default location some tools (e.g., Gradle) expect to find Java files.
